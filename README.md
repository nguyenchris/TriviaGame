# JavaScript Trivia Game

## Description
Web browser based trivia game that includes JavaScript questions. Each question displays a JavaScript code snippet for the user to see. Each question is timed for 45 seconds. If the user does not answer in time, the correct answer will be displayed and after a few seconds, the next question will appear. 

This trivia game was developed in order to focus on implementing `setTimeout` and  `setInteveral` methods as well as objects. It was also focused on implementing a modular JavaScript design by including immediately invoked function expressions (IIFE) and closures.
